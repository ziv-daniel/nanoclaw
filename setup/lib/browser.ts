/**
 * Browser-open helpers shared across channel setup flows.
 *
 * `openUrl` is best-effort — silent on failure, so headless/SSH/WSL
 * environments where `open`/`xdg-open` isn't wired up don't crash the
 * setup. The URL should always be visible in the clack note that calls
 * this so the user can copy-paste if the auto-open doesn't land.
 *
 * `confirmThenOpen` pauses for the operator before triggering the open —
 * the browser tends to steal focus when it pops, and a split-second
 * "wait what just happened" moment is worse than letting the user hit
 * Enter when they're ready. On headless devices (no graphical session
 * available) it skips both the prompt and the open: there's no browser
 * to launch, the surrounding `note(...)` already shows the URL for
 * copy-paste on another device, and the next prompt in the channel
 * flow ("Got your bot token?" etc.) provides the natural completion
 * confirmation.
