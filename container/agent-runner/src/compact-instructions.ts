/**
 * PreCompact hook script — outputs custom compaction instructions to stdout.
 *
 * Claude Code captures the stdout of PreCompact shell hooks and passes it
 * as `customInstructions` to the compaction prompt. This ensures the
 * compaction summary preserves message routing context that the agent needs
 * to correctly address responses.
 *
 * Invoked by the PreCompact hook in .claude-shared/settings.json:
 *   "command": "bun /app/src/compact-instructions.ts"
